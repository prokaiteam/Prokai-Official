            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This Terms and Conditions document is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the ProKai mobile application ("App"), website (if applicable), and related services ("Services") provided by ProKai, an Indian edtech startup registered under the Udyam Registration as a micro, small, or medium enterprise (MSME). ProKai's sole role is to sell high-quality, AI-powered prompt scripts designed for exam preparation, which users can utilize with third-party AI chatbots to generate study materials. ProKai does not guarantee exam success, AI performance, or any outcomes, as these depend entirely on the user's effort, dedication, and external factors beyond ProKai's control. The Services are limited to providing these digital scripts for one-time fees, enabling users to access exam-specific tools (Basic, Pro, or God/Advanced levels) that facilitate personalized learning via AI.</p>
            
            <p>By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App or Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy (incorporated by reference), and any additional guidelines or rules posted within the App. If you do not agree, you must not use the Services. These Terms form an electronic contract under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), and are compliant with the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act). ProKai reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time, with changes effective upon posting in the App or notification via email. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2>User Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
            <p>To use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, and capable of entering into a binding contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Minors (under 18) may use the Services only with the express consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian, who agrees to be bound by these Terms on their behalf. ProKai targets users preparing for Indian competitive exams, and assumes users are adults unless otherwise indicated.</p>
            
            <p>Account creation requires providing accurate information, including a valid email address for sign-in and media file access permissions for optional profile customization (e.g., uploading photos). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account. Notify ProKai immediately at prokai.team@gmail.com of any unauthorized access. ProKai may suspend or terminate your account if we suspect misuse, fraud, or violation of these Terms, without liability. Accounts are non-transferable, and you agree not to share login details or scripts with others, as this violates our no-sharing policy. You understand that your success in using the scripts depends on your own efforts, and ProKai bears no responsibility for your personal outcomes.</p>
            
            <p>In compliance with Google Play policies, we collect minimal user data (e.g., email for authentication) and ensure permissions are justified and transparent. You consent to ProKai contacting you via email, WhatsApp, or in-app notifications for service-related updates, promotions, or support, even if registered under Do Not Disturb (DND) services, as permitted for transactional communications.</p>

            <h2>Services and Products</h2>
            <p>ProKai's primary function is to sell high-quality AI prompt scripts tailored to exams such as SSC, UPSC, CBSE, JEE, NEET, GATE, and others, available in multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali). These scripts are categorized into Basic (3-year analysis), Pro (5-year), and God/Advanced (10-year) levels, offering features like unlimited MCQs, topic weightage tables, study plans, and interactive commands (e.g., "nex" for next questions, "Fqr" for explanations). ProKai does not create, host, or control the AI outputs; it only provides the scripts as tools for users to input into third-party AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude, DeepSeek).</p>
            
            <p>Scripts are delivered instantly upon purchase via the App, email, or WhatsApp. ProKai emphasizes that while the scripts are designed based on historical exam data to enhance preparation efficiency, the actual generation of study materials occurs through third-party AIs, over which ProKai has no control. Users must independently access these AIs, and ProKai disclaims any responsibility for their performance, accuracy, availability, updates, or any resulting content. Exam success, learning outcomes, or any benefits derived from the scripts depend entirely on the user's dedication, proper usage, verification of AI-generated materials, and personal circumstancesâ€”factors wholly in the user's hands. ProKai makes no representations or warranties regarding exam results, AI reliability, or educational efficacy, and users are strongly advised to independently verify all AI outputs for accuracy and relevance.</p>
            
            <p>The Services are provided "as is" without warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The App is rated "Everyone" on Google Play and requires no subscriptionsâ€”only one-time purchases. ProKai may update, modify, or discontinue Services or features at any time without notice or liability. Use is for personal, non-commercial educational purposes only; no resale, sharing, or modification of scripts is permitted. ProKai's liability is strictly confined to the delivery of the scripts, and no further obligations exist.</p>

            <h2>Payments and Refunds</h2>
            <p>All payments are processed securely through Razorpay, supporting UPI (e.g., PhonePe, GPay), credit/debit cards, net banking, and other methods. By paying, you agree to Razorpay's terms (available at https://razorpay.com/terms/). Prices start at â‚¹250 for Basic scripts, varying by exam complexity and level, exclusive of applicable taxes (e.g., GST). Payments are one-time, with no recurring charges or subscriptions.</p>
            
            <p>Due to the digital nature of the products (instant delivery and access), all sales are final, and no refunds are provided, except in verified cases of technical errors (e.g., non-delivery) at ProKai's discretion. Refunds, if approved, will be processed within 14 business days to the original payment method, less any processing fees. You must display and agree to this no-refund policy during checkout, as required by Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and Razorpay guidelines. ProKai is not liable for payment failures due to bank, network, or user errors. Your purchase confirms understanding that ProKai's role ends with script delivery, and any subsequent use or outcomes are your sole responsibility.</p>
            
            <p>If payment is successful but the script is not delivered, contact ProKai within 5 days at prokai.team@gmail.com with transaction ID, order ID, and payment screenshot to receive the script. If you do not contact within 5 days, ProKai will automatically initiate a full refund, which will be processed to your original payment method within 14 business days, less any processing fees.</p>
            
            <p>If the payment is unsuccessful (e.g., funds not received by ProKai), no script will be delivered, and the issue lies with your payment gateway (e.g., Google Pay, Paytm) or bank, not ProKai. ProKai has no involvement or liability in such cases.</p>
            
            <p>For payments in a pending state, ProKai will attempt to resolve issues originating from its side within 48 to 72 hours. If the pending status resolves to successful within this timeframe, the script will be delivered via your payment history. If it resolves to unsuccessful, or if the issue stems from your bank or payment gateway (e.g., Google Pay, Paytm), it is your and your bank's responsibility, not ProKai's.</p>

            <h2>Affiliate/Referral Program</h2>
            <p>ProKai offers a referral program where users can share unique referral links or codes via the App. If a referred user downloads the App and purchases a script, the referrer earns a commission of up to 10% of the purchase price (net of taxes), credited to their in-app wallet. Commissions vary by script level and are subject to verification (e.g., no self-referrals or spam).</p>
            
            <p>Wallets may have minimum withdrawal thresholds, and funds are withdrawable via approved methods (e.g., bank transfer), compliant with Indian tax laws. ProKai reserves the right to modify commission rates, suspend accounts for abuse (e.g., fraudulent referrals), or terminate the program without notice. Participants grant ProKai a license to use referral data for program administration and marketing. This program complies with Google Play policies on monetization and user incentives. Earnings are for personal use; no guarantees on income, and users are responsible for any applicable taxes. ProKai's involvement is limited to facilitating the program, with no responsibility for users' promotional activities or results.</p>
