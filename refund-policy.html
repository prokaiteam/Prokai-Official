        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        
        <p>ProKai ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to providing transparent and fair refund practices 
for our AI-powered prompt scripts and related services. This Refund Policy applies to all 
purchases made through the ProKai mobile application ("App") and is incorporated into our 
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. By making a purchase, you agree to this Policy.</p>

        <p>This Policy complies with Razorpay's payment gateway terms (available at 
https://razorpay.com/terms/), Google Play Store Developer Policies (including requirements 
for in-app purchases and refunds), and Indian laws, such as the Consumer Protection Act, 
2019 (CPA), Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), and Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
regulations. We do not offer refunds for digital products after delivery due to their nature 
(instant access and non-returnable), except in specific verified cases outlined below.</p>

        <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates 
will be notified via the App or email, and continued use constitutes acceptance. If you 
disagree, discontinue use and contact us for account deletion.</p>

        <h2>1. General Refund Rules</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>No Refunds for Digital Products Post-Delivery:</b> Our prompt scripts (Basic, Pro, or 

God/Advanced levels) are digital goods delivered instantly via the App, email, or 
WhatsApp upon successful payment. Once delivered and accessible, all sales are 
final, and no refunds are provided. This aligns with Razorpay's policy for digital 
content (non-refundable post-consumption) and Google Play's guidelines for 
consumable in-app products.</li>
            <li><b>Exceptions for Refunds:</b> Refunds are only approved in verified cases of technical 

errors or non-delivery, at ProKai's discretion. Examples include payment success 
without script delivery due to our system error. Refunds do not apply to user errors 
(e.g., forgetting to check email/ App) or dissatisfaction with script performance/AI 
outputs, as these are your responsibility (see Terms and Conditions, Point 10).</li>
            <li><b>Refund Processing Timeline:</b> Approved refunds are processed within 14 business 

days (excluding weekends and public holidays) to your original payment method 
(e.g., UPI, card). Processing fees (e.g., Razorpay charges, typically 1-2%) may be 
deducted, as per GST rules. Actual credit to your account may take additional 3-5 
days depending on your bank/gateway.</li>
            <li><b>GST and Taxes:</b> Refunds include reversal of applicable GST (18% for edtech 

services). If partial, GST is adjusted proportionally per GST Act.</li>
            <li><b>Chargebacks and Disputes:</b> Chargebacks (payment reversals initiated by you via 

your bank) are discouraged and may lead to account suspension. If initiated, you 
must first contact us; unfounded chargebacks violate our Terms (Point 8) and may 
incur fees. Razorpay handles chargeback investigations, but ProKai cooperates only 
for our-side issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="clear-instructions">
            <h3>Clear Instructions for Users:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What to Do (Right Actions): Review this Policy before purchase. If eligible, request 

refunds with evidence (e.g., transaction ID). For chargebacks, contact us first via 
prokai.team@gmail.com.</li>
                <li>What Not to Do (Wrong Actions): Do not initiate chargebacks without notifying us. Do 

not request refunds for post-delivery dissatisfaction or user errors.</li>
                <li>Responsibilities: It is your responsibility to verify delivery and provide accurate 

evidence for refund requests. ProKai's responsibility is limited to processing 
approved refunds within timelines; bank delays are your bank's responsibility.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Specific Refund Scenarios</h2>
        <p>We outline common scenarios for clarity, in line with Razorpay's dispute resolution, Google 
Play's in-app purchase rules (requiring refunds for undelivered items), and CPA's consumer 
grievance mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>a. Payment Successful but Script Not Delivered</h3>
        <p>If funds are deducted and the transaction is marked successful in the App, but the script is 
not received (e.g., not in App, email, or WhatsApp):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact us within 5 days at prokai.team@gmail.com or in-app support, providing 
transaction ID, order ID, and payment screenshot. We will deliver the script promptly.</li>
            <li>If you do not contact within 5 days, we will automatically initiate a full refund, processed 
within 14 business days, less processing fees.</li>
            <li>This complies with Google Play's requirement for automatic refunds on undelivered digital 
goods and Razorpay's non-delivery dispute handling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Payment Unsuccessful (Funds Not Received by ProKai)</h3>
        <p>If payment fails (e.g., error message) and no funds reach us, no script is delivered. This is 
between you and your payment gateway/bank (e.g., Google Pay, Paytm)—not ProKai's 
liability. Retry or contact your bank. No refund needed, as no charge occurred on our end.</p>

        <h3>c. Payment Pending</h3>
        <p>If payment is pending (e.g., due to bank verification):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We resolve our-side issues within 48-72 hours. If it becomes successful, the script is 
delivered via payment history.</li>
            <li>If unsuccessful or due to your bank/gateway, contact them—it is not ProKai's 
responsibility. No script until success.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>d. Payment Debited but Not Received by ProKai</h3>
        <p>If funds are debited from your bank but not credited to us (e.g., network error), the 
transaction is unsuccessful on our end. No script is delivered. Resolve with your 
bank/gateway—ProKai has no liability.</p>

        <h3>e. Other Issues (e.g., Duplicate Payments, Fraud)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Duplicate: If charged twice due to error, contact us with evidence; we refund the extra 
within 14 business days.</li>
            <li>Fraud: If suspected (e.g., unauthorized payment), report to your bank and us. We 
cooperate with Razorpay's fraud team but are not liable for user-end fraud.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="clear-instructions">
            <h3>Clear Instructions for Users:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What to Do (Right Actions): Monitor payment status post-purchase. Contact us/bank 

promptly with evidence for eligible issues.</li>
                <li>What Not to Do (Wrong Actions): Do not ignore pending statuses or assume 

automatic delivery/refunds without contact.</li>
                <li>Responsibilities: It is your responsibility to track transactions and provide proof. 

ProKai's responsibility is limited to our-side errors; gateway/bank issues are yours.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Email prokai.team@gmail.com or use in-app support with:</li>
            <li>Order/transaction ID.</li>
            <li>Payment screenshot/proof.</li>
            <li>Description of issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We verify within 48-72 hours and notify you. If approved, refund processes as above.</p>
        <p>Grievance Officer: Raajveer (Founder & CEO), contact via email for escalations. 
Unresolved issues can go to consumer forums under CPA.</p>

        <h2>4. No Refunds for Certain Cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Post-delivery dissatisfaction (e.g., script not meeting expectations, AI issues).</li>
            <li>User errors (e.g., wrong exam selected, device incompatibility).</li>
            <li>Referral commissions (non-refundable, withdrawable per Terms).</li>
            <li>Changes in Terms/Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This aligns with Razorpay's no-refund for consumed digital goods, Google Play's 
consumable policies, and CPA's fair trade practices.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
