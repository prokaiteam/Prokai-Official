                    processing payments, managing referrals, and improving user experience. We adhere to data
                    minimization principles, collecting only what is required. We do not collect or process data related
                    to your interactions with third-party AIs (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok) or your study outcomes, as these are
                    entirely your responsibility.</p>

                <h3>a. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
                <ul>

                        collect transaction details via Razorpay, including payment method (e.g., UPI, card, bank
                        transfer). We do not store sensitive payment details like card numbers or CVVs; these are
                        handled securely by Razorpay in compliance with PCI-DSS standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Referral and Affiliate Information:</strong> Referral codes or links you share, and

                    <li><strong>Communication Information:</strong> If you request script delivery via email or
                        WhatsApp, we collect the provided contact details. We also collect any information you share in

                        data unless explicitly required (e.g., for geocode-based features, which we do not currently
                        use).</li>
                    <li><strong>App Permissions:</strong> We request access to media files solely for uploading profile

                <p>ProKai complies with Google AdMob program policies (which incorporate AdSense policies)
                    for all advertisements displayed in the App, including rewarded ads used to promote or
                    unlock access to our Basic level scripts. We use AdMob to offer users two options for
                    acquiring the Basic script:<br>(1) purchase with money via Razorpay, or <br>(2) watch rewarded ads
                    to unlock it for free (no cost, but ads must be viewed completely to receive the script). Pro
                    and God/Advanced level scripts are available only through monetary purchase—no
                    ad-based free access is provided for these tiers</p>

                <strong>Key Compliance Details:
                </strong>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rewarded Ads for Free Access:</strong> Rewarded ads are optional and clearly labeled.
                        Users must actively choose to watch ads to unlock the Basic script, and completion is
                        required for delivery. This aligns with AdMob's rewarded ad guidelines, ensuring user
                        consent and no invalid traffic (e.g., no auto-plays, forced views, or misleading
                        prompts).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ad Placement and User Experience:</strong> Ads are placed non-intrusively, without
                        interfering with core App functionality or misleading users (e.g., no ads disguised as
                        App content). We prohibit invalid clicks, such as encouraging accidental taps or
                        offering incentives beyond the script unlock.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Prohibited Practices:</strong> No ads promote illegal activities, violate intellectual
                        property,
                        or target sensitive categories. We monitor for fraud using AdMob tools and terminate
                        access for violations (as per Terms Point 8 and 12).

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>User Consent and Privacy:</strong> Ads require explicit user interaction. Data from ad
                        interactions is handled per our Privacy Policy and DPDPA 2023—no sharing for
                        unrelated purposes. Users can manage ad preferences via device settings.


                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Promotion of Paid Content:</strong> Ads may promote all script levels but clearly
                        distinguish free ad-based access (Basic only) from paid tiers. This complies with
                        AdMob's policies on truthful advertising and no deceptive claims.
